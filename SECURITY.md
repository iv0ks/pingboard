# Security Policy

## This project is intentionally vulnerable

pingboard is an **educational security lab**. It contains a **deliberate**
broken access control vulnerability — a write IDOR / mass assignment (CWE-639).
Please do **not** report the intended authorization flaw as a security issue —
it is the entire point of the project and is documented in the README, GUIDE.md
and SOLUTION.md.

## Reporting *unintended* issues

If you find a problem that is **not** the intended lab vulnerability — for
example, a supply-chain issue, a problem in the CI/CD configuration, or a way
the container could harm the host — please open a private report via GitHub
Security Advisories, or open an issue describing the concern.

## Safe usage

- Run this only on systems you own, locally, isolated (Docker is recommended).
- Never expose this application to the public internet.
- Never use the techniques demonstrated here against systems without explicit,
  written authorization.
